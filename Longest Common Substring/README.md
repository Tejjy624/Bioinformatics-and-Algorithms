Longest Common Subsequence Problem

Given: Two strings.
Return: A longest common subsequence of these strings.

Your code must have a function named `main` that will take as input the two input strings and return the LCS. The tester will load the strings itself and will call this function from your code with them:

```
import lcs
lcs = lcs.main(v, w)
```

Your code will work as long as you have the `main` function defined. As there are multiple LCS strings possible, the tester will check if your output matches the LCS length and if it is a subsequences of both inputs.


You can run the tester as below:

```
python tester.py
```

Your `lcs.py` file should be in the same directory as the tester.
